## Inspiration
I just recently learned how to use and write in SQL, specifically PostgreSQL. I wanted to work on a small dataset construction project and I chose Pokemon as the main source and theme of the project. With that said, I did not construct this entire data set on my own. I merely added to what Mario Hernández (@maca11) and Rounak Banik (@rounakbanik) had already created - All Pokemon Dataset & The Complete Pokemon Dataset.
